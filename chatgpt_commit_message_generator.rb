# This script uses the OpenAI API to generate a commit message based on the
# changes that have been staged. It then copies the commit message to the
# clipboard and prompts the user to either submit the commit with the generated
# message, edit the message before submitting, or exit without committing.
#
# You need to have an OpenAI API key to use this script.
# You can get an API key by signing up for an OpenAI account at
# https://beta.openai.com/.

# Requirements:
#   - Ruby 2.6 or higher
#   - Bundler
#   - OpenAI API key set in OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable

question = <<~QUESTION
  I need you to create a commit message for me based on these guidelines:

  - Use the past tense for the commit message.
  - Include a subject line and a body with a bulleted list of more details.
  - The subject line should be followed by a blank line
  - The subject line should be a single line that is no longer than 50 characters
  - If the changes only include 1 file, then the subject line should include the file name.
  - The body should use bullets if appropriate.
  - The lines in the body should wrap at 72 characters

  Format your response as JSON with the following structure:
  ```json
  {
    "subject": "<SUBJECT_LINE>",
    "body": "<BODY>"
  }
  ```

  Here are the differences for the commit:
  ```#{staged_content}```
